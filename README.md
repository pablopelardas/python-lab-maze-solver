# Python Lab - Maze Solver

As the title says, this is a lab project to learn python in a practical way recommended by [BootDev](https://www.boot.dev/tracks/backend).

The goal of the project is to make a Maze Solver using Python's Library *tkinter*

The project builds a maze using recursion, and then uses a similar algorithm to traverse it leaving a red path. It makes random mazes in different runs, the python *random* library.


## Installation

To run the project you must have Python newer than 3.10 and tkinter installed. Run the following commands to see if you meet these requirements.

```bash
python --version
python -m tkinter
```
    

## Run the project

To deploy this project run

```bash
  python main.py
```
